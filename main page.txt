                <h1 class="heading">RECYCLING</h1>
                <p class="para">Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials. It helps reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, energy usage, air pollution, and water pollution. Recycling can also lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to virgin production. Common materials that are recycled include paper, glass, metal, plastic, and textiles.

                    There are several benefits to recycling, including:
                    
                    Conservation of natural resources: Recycling helps conserve resources such as timber, water, and minerals.
                    Energy savings: Recycling typically requires less energy than producing new products from raw materials.
                    Reduction of landfill waste: Recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, helping to alleviate the pressure on these sites.
                    Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions: Recycling can help lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction, processing, and transportation of raw materials.
                    To promote recycling, individuals and communities can participate in recycling programs, separate recyclable materials from trash, and purchase products made from recycled materials.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL</h1>
                <p class="para">Hazardous waste disposal refers to the safe and responsible management of waste materials that pose a threat to human health and the environment. Hazardous wastes include materials that are toxic, flammable, reactive, or corrosive. Proper disposal of hazardous waste is essential to prevent contamination of soil, water, and air.

There are several methods for disposing of hazardous waste, including:

Landfill disposal: Hazardous waste is disposed of in specially designed landfills that are engineered to prevent leaching of contaminants into the environment.
Incineration: Hazardous waste can be burned at high temperatures in specially designed incinerators. This process reduces the volume of waste and can destroy harmful chemicals.
Chemical treatment: Hazardous waste can be treated with chemicals to neutralize or stabilize the contaminants, making them less harmful.
Recycling: Some hazardous wastes, such as certain solvents and metals, can be recycled and reused in industrial processes.
Secure landfill: Some hazardous wastes, such as radioactive materials, may require disposal in secure landfills designed to contain and isolate the waste.
Proper disposal of hazardous waste is regulated by government agencies to ensure that it is managed safely and in compliance with environmental regulations.</p>
